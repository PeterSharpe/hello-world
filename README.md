HI, Peter Sharpe is a 75 year old who programmed in Fortran in the late 1960s, at University on one of the few computers in the country, then in Basic in the early 70s, then in Pick Basic in the early 80s.  He created a sales/orders stock control and a bill of materials system for an early kitset furnature company which reduced delivery times by 70% and reduced stock by 20% while increasing sales by 300%.  An elderly lady in the office was convinced she would not be able to stay 1) because the computer would do many of her tasks type orders, invoices statements etc and there would be little work for her to do. It gave me amazing confidence to find her still there 3 years latter when I called in and told me " I really love my job now, I do only the things I love doing!"
